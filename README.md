# E-Commerce Sequelize Application
An application that allows users check the database of an e-commerce website and see the different products, categoties, and tags that are associated to the products.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this application because it was a great opportunity to learn all about sequelize. Sequelize was a completely new concept for me so this project was a great way to put what I had learned to the test and have a frame of reference for the future.
- I created this project to work on my Node JS, Express.js, and Sequelize skills. I think this was a great way for me to get familiar with the more professional and standard way of completing these projects.
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of allowing users to access URLs and receive the information that they are looking for.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using Sequelize and plan to keep building projects to build on my knowledge!

## Installation

- In order to use this application, the user will need to have access to the command line.
- Once they are in the command line, they will need to cd into the e-commerce-sequelize and then the Develop folder.
- Once in the folder, the user will have to run npm start in the command line.
- From there, the user will be able to use Insomnia to use the routes created through Sequelize
